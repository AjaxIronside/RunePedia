# RunePedia
![alt text](https://github.com/AjaxIronside/RunePedia/blob/master/Release/html/RS%20Logo.png?raw=true "Logo")


An offline, custom-written Runescape Classic encyclopedia.

At this point, it's serving as my final project for a Software Engineering course, but after I've submitted my work I will welcome contributors!

## About
RunePedia is current to the last released build of Runescape Classic, before its untimely 2018 demise. As such, it should be useful for any current fan-recreations of Runescape Classic, including OpenRSC, RSC Singleplayer and RSC Revolution, although any custom content implemented by these projects will not be reflected in RunePedia.

## Installation
RunePedia is currently compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows 7 and Windows 10. There are plans in the future to make the program as backwards-compatible as possible, as far back as Java 8 supports, as this is the version of Java most Runescape Classic recreations currently support. This means at the very least that Windows XP will be supported, although some serious considerations to HTML coding style will need to be assessed.

RunePedia requires nothing but the files included in the "Release" folder. Make sure that your RunePedia.exe and the "html" folder are inside the same parent folder and everything will work swimmingly no matter where you install it. You may, if you wish, create a shortcut on the desktop and put the RunePedia contents somewhere hidden away to reduce desktop clutter.

Microsoft Edge is recommended for compatibility reasons, as RunePedia is designed to utilize the most recent version of Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge that is found on your system to display its HTML content. Older versions of IE are liable to misrepresent some styling and content.

## Later Goals
I would like to eventually port RunePedia (in its final state) to mobile devices for a handy handheld reference.
