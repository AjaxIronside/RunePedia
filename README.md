# RunePedia
![alt text](https://github.com/AjaxIronside/RunePedia/blob/master/Release/html/RS%20Logo.png?raw=true "Logo")


An online, custom-written Runescape Classic encyclopedia.

Last year, I built out RunePedia as an Offline-only app to make searching for Runescape Classic information quicker on Windows systems. Now, I want to build a fully-responsive web app that will allow Runescape Classic fans to access that information from anywhere, and I need your help!

## About
RunePedia is current to the last released build of Runescape Classic, before its untimely 2018 demise. As such, it should be useful for any current fan-recreations of Runescape Classic, including OpenRSC, RSC Singleplayer and RSC Revolution, although any custom content implemented by these projects will not be reflected in RunePedia.

## Installation

Load this repository's contents into Brackets or a similar HTML editor and get coding! We need to build out information into its own pages, as well as finishing the responsive theme for the website itself.

## Later Goals
I would like to eventually port RunePedia (in its final state) to mobile devices for a handy handheld reference.
